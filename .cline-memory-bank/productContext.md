# Product Context: Splainer TypeScript/React Rewrite

## Why This Project Exists
The Splainer application needs a modern rewrite to improve maintainability, developer experience, and performance. The legacy AngularJS application is becoming difficult to maintain and extend, while the new React/TypeScript version will provide:
- Better type safety with TypeScript
- Modern component architecture with React
- Improved developer experience with Vite
- Better testability and maintainability
- Enhanced performance and scalability

## What This Application Solves
- Provides a user interface for interacting with Solr/Elasticsearch search engines
- Allows users to search, view, and analyze search results
- Offers configuration and settings management
- Provides detailed document views and explanations
- Supports custom headers and advanced search features

## How It Should Work
1. User accesses the application through a web interface
2. User can configure search settings (Solr/Elasticsearch URLs, etc.)
3. User can perform searches and view results
4. User can drill down into individual documents for detailed analysis
5. User can configure application settings and preferences

## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive and responsive user interface
- Fast loading and responsive interactions
- Clear visual hierarchy and information presentation
- Consistent design patterns throughout the application
- Accessible and usable for all users
