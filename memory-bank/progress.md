# Progress: Splainer React Migration

## What Works
- Successfully analyzed legacy AngularJS codebase
- Created comprehensive documentation in memory bank
- Identified key components and services needed for migration
- Examined existing React component structure
- Understood the core functionality and data flow

## What's Left to Build
- Create TypeScript interfaces for legacy services
- Implement React component with equivalent functionality
- Map AngularJS controller logic to React hooks
- Ensure proper integration with existing React application
- Test functionality and UI behavior

## Current Status
The project is in the analysis and planning phase. Documentation is complete and the core understanding of the legacy system is established. The next phase involves implementing the React component.

## Known Issues
- Need to understand the exact data structures used in legacy services
- Must ensure compatibility with existing React application structure
- Need to preserve all existing UI behavior and functionality

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decided to focus on SearchResults component migration
- Chose to maintain existing UI structure and behavior
- Selected React hooks for state management instead of AngularJS scope
- Confirmed TypeScript will be used for type safety
